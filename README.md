## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working through this project, I solidified my understanding of responsive design principles, particularly in how to handle different screen sizes using CSS Grid and media queries. I also improved my skills in implementing the BEM methodology for organizing CSS classes, which helps to maintain scalability and readability in stylesheets.

Some key takeaways include:

```html
<h1 class="team__title">The creative crew</h1>
```

```css
.team__members {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to keep focusing on enhancing my use of CSS Grid to create more complex layouts, and I aim to continue refining my approach to responsive design. Additionally, Iâ€™m looking to improve my use of asynchronous JavaScript, especially for handling API requests efficiently and optimizing page performance.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) - This resource helped me understand how to make my layout more responsive and flexible. I'll definitely use it again in future projects.
